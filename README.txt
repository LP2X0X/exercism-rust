# Exercism Rust Track Solutions 🦀

This repository contains my personal solutions to all exercises in the [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust) Rust track.

## 📚 About

[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a platform that offers hands-on coding practice and mentorship. This repo showcases my journey through the Rust exercises — covering topics like ownership, lifetimes, pattern matching, iterators, and more.

All solutions are written in idiomatic Rust and reflect my understanding and progress as I learn the language.

## 🛠 Structure

Each folder represents an individual exercise, named after the problem slug as provided by Exercism. Inside each folder, you'll typically find:

- `src/` – Solution source code
- `tests/` – Unit or integration tests
- `Cargo.toml` – Project metadata and dependencies

## ✅ Progress

To see my progress and which exercises I've completed, you can visit my Exercism profile:

## 📖 License

This repository is for personal learning purposes. If you're also solving Rust exercises on Exercism, please use this repo for reference only — not for copy/paste solutions. Learning is most effective when you solve problems yourself. 🙂

Happy hacking and keep rusting! 🦀✨
